<p><font color="000fff" size="12">Mu?ammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, Arabized as al-Khwarizmi with al- and formerly Latinized as
 Algorithmi, was a Persian scholar who produced works in mathematics, astronomy, and 
geography. Around 820 AD he was appointed as the astronomer and head of the library of the House of
 Wisdom in Baghdad.</p><p align="center">

<p>Al-Khwarizmi's popularizing treatise on algebra (The Compendious Book on Calculation byCompletiom
 and Balancing, c. 813â€“833 CE presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic
 equations. One of his principal achievements in algebra was his demonstration of how to solve 
quadratic equations by completing the square, for which he provided geometric justifications.
 Because he was the first to treat algebra as an independent discipline and introduced the methods
 of "reduction" and "balancing" (the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an
 equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation) he has
 been described as the father or founder of algebra. The term algebra itself comes 
from the title of his book (specifically the word al-jabr meaning "completion" or "rejoining"). 
His name gave rise to the terms algorism and algorithm. His name is also the origin of (Spanish)
 guarismo and of (Portuguese) algarismo, both meaning digit.</p>

<p>In the 12th century, Latin translations of his textbook on arithmetic (Algorithmo de Numero Indorum)
 which codified the various Indian numerals, introduced the decimal positional number system to the
 Western world. The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, translated into
 Latin by Robert of Chester in 1145, was used until the sixteenth century as the principal
 mathematical text-book of European universities.</p>
