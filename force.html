<font size="12" color="#119911><p>some important definitions of this chapter are given below;-
<ul type="square">
<li><b>laws of motions are:-</b>
<ol type="1">
     <li>A body which is in the rest or motion will rest in its state and change only when a external
force is applied to it.
     <li>The rate of change of momentum on an object is directly proportional to force applied on it.
     <li>Every action has equal and opposite reactions.

</ol>
<li>Force(F):-The product of mass and accleration is known as force.
<li>Momentum(M):-The product of mass and velocity is known as momentum.
<li>Some formulas related to this chapter are:-
<ul type="disc">
<li>F=ma
<li>P=mv
<li>m<sub>1</sub>u<sub>1</sub>+m<sub>2</sub>u<sub>2</sub>=m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>+m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>
</ul>
