<p><font size="12" color="">Aryabhata or Aryabhata 
 (476â€“550 CE) was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age
 of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the Aryabha?iya (which mentions 
that in 3600 Kaliyuga, 499 CE, he was 23 years old) and the Arya-siddhanta.</p>

<p>For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.
In Ganitapada 6, Aryabhata gives the area of a triangle astribhujasya phalasarira? samadalako?i 
bhujardhasa?varga?that translates to: "for a triangle, the result of a perpendicular with the
 half-side is the area.</p>

<p>Aryabhata discussed the concept of sine in his work by the name of ardha-jya, which literally
 means "half-chord". For simplicity, people started calling it jya. When Arabic writers translated 
his works from Sanskrit into Arabic, they referred it as jiba. However, in Arabic writings, vowels
 are omitted, and it was abbreviated as jb. Later writers substituted it with jaib, meaning "pocket"
 or "fold (in a garment)". (In Arabic, jiba is a meaningless word.) Later in the 12th century, when 
Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic jaib 
with its Latin counterpart, sinus, which means "cove" or "bay"; thence comes the English word sine.
