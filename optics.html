<p>Optics includes study of dispersion of light.
Optics is the branch of physics that studies the behaviour and properties of light, including its
 interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect it.[1] Optics 
usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. Because light is an
 electromagnetic wave, other forms of electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays, microwaves, and
 radio waves exhibit similar properties.</p>

<p>Most optical phenomena can be accounted for using the classical electromagnetic description of 
light. Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often difficult to apply in
 practice. Practical optics is usually done using simplified models. The most common of these, 
geometric optics, treats light as a collection of rays that travel in straight lines and bend when
 they pass through or reflect from surfaces. Physical optics is a more comprehensive model of light,
 which includes wave effects such as diffraction and interference that cannot be accounted for in 
geometric optics. Historically, the ray-based model of light was developed first, followed by the
 wave model of light. Progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery
 that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation.</p></font>
