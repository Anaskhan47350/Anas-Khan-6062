<p><font size="24" color="">Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay, radioactivity, radioactive
 disintegration or nuclear disintegration) is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses
 energy (in terms of mass in its rest frame) by radiation, such as an alpha particle, beta particle with
 neutrino or only a neutrino in the case of electron capture, or a gamma ray or electron in the 
case of internal conversion. A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive.
 Certain highly excited short-lived nuclear states can decay through neutron emission, or more rarely,
 proton emission.</p>

<p>Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of single atoms. According to
 quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay,[1][2][3] regardless
 of how long the atom has existed. However, for a collection of atoms, the expected decay rate is
 characterized in terms of measured decay constants or half-lives. This is the basis of radiometric
 dating. The half-lives of radioactive atoms have no known upper limit, spanning a time range of over
 55 orders of magnitude, from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe.
