<font size="12"><p>Electricity is a chapter of physics which is related with charge,curent and 
potential difference in a wire.</p>
<p>Some definitions related to this chapters are:-
<ol type="i">
<li><b>Charge</b>:-It is a physical property of a quanta of matter.It is of two types
<ul type="disc"><li><b>positive charge:-</b>The particles of matter which contain more number of proton than 
electron are positively charge.
                <li><b>Negative charge:-</b>The particles which contain more number of electron than
a proton are negatively charge.
</ul>
<li><b>Current:-</b>Curent is movement of charge particles in a conductor when a potential difference
is applied to its ends.Its S.I unit is ampere.It is denoted by <i>I</i>
<li><b>voltage:-</b>It is energy to move a charge particles from infinity to a point.It is also
called potential difference.Its S.I unit is volt(V).
</ol></p>
<p>Some formulas related to this chapter are:-
<ul type="disc">
<li>Q=n*e
<li>I=Q/t
<li>V=W/Q
<li>V<sub>AB</sub>=W<sub>A</sub>-W<sub>B</sub>/Q
<li>Ohm's law=V=I*R
<li>P=I<sup>2</sup>*R
<li>H=V*I*T
<li>H=I<sup>2</sup>R*t
<li>P=V*I
